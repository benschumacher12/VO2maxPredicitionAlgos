# nonexerciseVO2maxPredicition
This repository contains the code used to develop non-exercise based VO2max prediction algorithms in older adults. 

Specifically, we sought to compare the performance of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), xgboost (with a tree and a linear booster), random forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in their ability to predict maximal oxygen uptake in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). In order to assess the feasibility of transporting these algorithms to an external cohort, we also trained the aforementioned algorthims using features available in both the BLSA and Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health in Older Women (OPACH) cohorts.
